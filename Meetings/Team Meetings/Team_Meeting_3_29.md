## Reviewed task
    1. Kush and Hazel finised up QA Process, Kush will pin Hazel when CI/CD pipeline is done
    2. Nathan illustarated the function of the staging environment around 00:23:00 of the recording
        For Chen, Dong and Tao, verify with Nathan firstly when they want to push theri code
    4. For the correct functionalities, files for the staging environment will not be palced in a single file.
    5. Perfomance requirements are not required at this stage
    6. Space for deployment: Nathan will put a line like 'will come more details later'
    7. Links of tools: Nathan will add something like links of Slack, GitLab from the client...
    8. Space for coding: will migrate MATILDA to another repo. will be addressed by Nathan on that deldicated page

## Tasks that will be finished in the later time of Sprint 1
    Set up CI/CD by Kush: the component enables checking against test cases, when you commit to the staging branch, and  
                            then auto. merge to main. The workflows will also work. Testcases also needs to be provided when
                            the coder commit. may add more details

    Look into ML class by Lam and Kush: write the code in python , take matadata for feature selection and Evaluationof performance,
                            and to check whether he will get similar putputs, may needs to refer the meeting recording.
                            may add more details
