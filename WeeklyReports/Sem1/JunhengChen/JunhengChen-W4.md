## What I have done this week
- write the sprint planning meeting agenda (2h)
- line up all the tasks that need to be done for the 1st progress assessment
- design the current workflow that agreed by the crew (1h)
- lead the sprint planning meeting, estimate story points with group,guarantee the our discussion was stick on the scope (3h)

## Key issues / blockers
- I stil know little about the codes that provided by the client, as I didn't have sufficient time to do the research
- I am responsible for maintaining our Kanban of the repository. There are 24 tasks on the board, and I need to write all the acceptance criteria and verify for them. It could be better that 1 extra member can collaborate with me on that work.

## What I plan to do next week
- maintaining the kanban, notice the progress, and make sure all the required tasks will come through
- watch the video that posted on the MATILDA website thoroughly
- write the agenda for the sprint review meeting for the next Friday
- fill up all the tasks on the kanban with their A.C.
- get the kick off understanding 
- begin to code for stubs with Dong
