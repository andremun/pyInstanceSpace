**Weekly Report: Kushagra Khare - Week 4**

**Accomplishments:**
1. Reviewed the current capabilities of MATILDA through following the tutorials (2 hrs)
2. Reviewed the team objectives for the coming months (3 hrs)
3. Looking into PyTorch and Tensorflow for Matlab Machine Learning substitutes (2 hrs)

**Key Issues Encountered:**
1. Git merge queue and workflow setup cannot be automated until the technology stack was decided
2. Machine Learning libraries for the Python had a somewhat steep learning curve

**Plan for Next Week:**
1. Complete Github Issues that were assigned to me
2. Finish learning Pytorch and Tensorflow to learn about Matlab library substitution
