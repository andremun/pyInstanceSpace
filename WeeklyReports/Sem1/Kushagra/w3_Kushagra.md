**Weekly Report: Kushagra Khare - Week 3**
**Accomplishments:**
1. Reviewed the LMS Overview of the project (0.5 hrs)
2. Reviewed the Client Meeting as well as Repository to understand the requirements from the client (2hrs)
3. Cloned the client repository in order to understand the current functionalities (3hrs)
4. Researched into possible substitute libraries for the Matlab functionalities (2hrs)
5. Looked into automated CI/CD Integration for the suggested stack as well as python (2hrs)
**Key Issues Encountered:**
1. Automated CI/CD Integration and unit testing require specific permissions to enable that aren't possible without having administrator rights
2. Not all Matlab functionalities can be substituted in a straightforward manner in Python due to different levels of abstractions
**Plan for Next Week:**
1. Request permissions for the repository and look into alternative methods of setting up automated CI/CD
2. Perform more research into Matlab and experiment with migrating some functionalities into Python
