## What you have done this week
- Start implementing random forest in python using the features provided in the website 
- Research and understand how to write test cases for matlab and start writing the first test case
- Take part in client meeting and discuss with clients about the possibility of using other opotimising ML algorithm that potentially increase accuracy 
- Take part in team meeting on good friday and elaborate to other members abouot the desired way to carry out testing and implementing ML algorithm

## Key issues / blockers
- time issue: my family came and i have vacation with them hence couldn't take part more in documentation staff. I will focus on testing and implementation of ML algorithm once i finished my vacation. I appreciate my teammates for the understanding and patience. 

## What you plan to do next week
- Finish at least 5-7 test cases for matlab and make it run 
- Finish implementing random forest ML algorithm using the feature provided on website
