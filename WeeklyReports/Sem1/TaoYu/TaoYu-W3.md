## What you have done this week
- Read the related materials provided by the project owner (2h), including:
  - The basic information and demonstration video of the MATILDA.
  - The repository containing the backend code of the current MATILDA.
  - PyHard, example of what we will need to Build.
- Read the meeting minutes of the client meeting (0.5h).
- Do the research on the technologies that we might need to use in this project. (2h)

## Key issues / blockers
- No adequate information about the project until the day before the client meeting, so I didn't have enough time to go through and understand everything before the team meeting and bring out any constructive question on the meeting.
- Late confirmation of the meeting time with the client, which caused I can't attend due to other commitment.

## What you plan to do next week
- Deep dive into the current codebase provided by the project owner.
- Learn related knowledge that need for migration from Matlab to Python.
- Cooperate with the team to complete next week's tasks.
