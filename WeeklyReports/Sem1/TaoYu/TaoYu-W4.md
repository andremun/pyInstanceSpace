## What you have done this week
- Watched the two demonstration videos on the MATILDA page.
- Have the spring planning meeting with team members.
- Started to look into the codebase.

## Key issues / blockers
- Since I have 3 assignments due this week, I didn't contribute much to the project, so I still don't have a clear understanding of the codebase. Need to catch up this week.

## What you plan to do next week
- Have a meeting with Dong and Junheng to start creating python module, write stub funtion definitions, add type definitions from existing Matlab code.
- Cooperate with the team to complete next week's tasks.
