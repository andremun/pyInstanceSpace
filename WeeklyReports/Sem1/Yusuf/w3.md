**Key Issues Encountered:**

1. The client's lack of clarity on certain project aspects presented challenges in defining the project scope and planning, requiring further clarification to establish a comprehensive roadmap.
2. Time constraints resulting from organizing a symposium limited availability for project-related tasks and meetings, necessitating efficient time management to balance responsibilities effectively.
3. Coordinating team meetings with ten people proved challenging due to conflicting schedules among team members, emphasizing the need for flexible scheduling options to accommodate everyone's availability.
4. Exploring research topics within the healthcare and med tech domains revealed complexities in finding a suitable focus within the specified word limit, requiring careful consideration and refinement of potential themes.

**Plan for Next Week:**

1. Seek clarification from the client to address uncertainties in project front-end sections, ensuring a clear understanding of expectations for the UI to make project planning effective.
