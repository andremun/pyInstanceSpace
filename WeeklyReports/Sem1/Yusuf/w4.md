**Weekly Report: Yusuf Berdan Guzel - Week 4**

**Accomplishments:**

1. Spent 2 hours watching the videos provided by the client, gaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying logic of the software.

2. Dedicated 2 hours to reviewing the codebase and checking MATLAB practices to ensure familiarity with project components and best practices.

3. Planned the Friday's meeting with our Scrum Master, allocating 30 minutes to coordinate schedules and set objectives for the upcoming session.

4. Collaborated with the team to plan the next client meeting and created the first set of tasks to be completed. This planning session consumed approximately 2 hours.

5. Finalized the research proposal, sourced relevant articles, and submitted the proposal, investing around 3 hours in this task.

**Key Issues Encountered:**

1. Encountered difficulty in comprehending some technical jargon within the research proposal, requiring additional effort to ensure clarity and accuracy.

2. The client's delayed response to our inquiries regarding front-end clarifications impeded progress and planning for the project.

3. Setting up the GitHub repository took longer than anticipated, resulting in a delay in establishing a central platform for project collaboration and version control.

4. Team members' conflicting commitments during workshop hours hindered productive discussions and collaborative problem-solving sessions.

5. Finding research essays for the research proposal took more time than expected, resulting in investigating fewer essays than I hoped for.

**Plan for Next Week:**

1. Organize another client meeting to address outstanding queries and confirm project requirements.

2. Finalize the requirements document to ensure alignment with client expectations and project objectives.

3. Update the team backlog page to reflect current project priorities and tasks.

4. Update the GitHub repository with the project deliverables for the first assignment, checking the deliverables of the team members.
