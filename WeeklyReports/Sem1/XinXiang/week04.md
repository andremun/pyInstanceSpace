## What I have done this week

1. Watched a 2-hour tutorial video on instance space analysis to grasp the foundational knowledge required for the project.

2. Spent around 2 hours examining the entire codebase, searching for potential packages that could mimic MATLAB functionalities.

3. Reviewed the acceptance criteria and contributed personal suggestions to enhance discussions in the upcoming team meeting on Friday.

4. Engaged in the initial sprint planning meeting with the team, contributing to collaborative decision-making.

5. Completed the research proposal within approximately 4 hours, laying a solid groundwork for the project.

## Key issues / blockers
1. Awaiting access to the frontend code to commence work on the architecture diagram and to understand the APIs utilized in the prior system

## What I plan to do next week
1. Attend a meeting focused on learning about environment deployment using Docker and how each system component interacts.

2. Draft the first version of the MATILDA system's architecture diagram, aiming to outline the system's structural design.

3. Dive into further research by reading articles on the application of AI in software testing, enhancing my understanding and contributing to the project's innovation.

4. Collaborate closely with the team to ensure the first sprint progresses smoothly, focusing on aligning all documentation with the project's initial submission requirements.
