## Things I worked on this week
- Read and review the project requirements from the LMS, and watch demonstration videos of MATLIDA's existing capabilities
- Research technologies that could potentially suit the project requirements like docker, kubernetes pandas, numpy and next.js
- Review existing backend code from https://github.com/andremun/InstanceSpace
- Prepare questions for the client meeting, to get a better understanding about the background of the project, scope, and the key requirements
- Coordinate a time with the team for the client meeting by setting up a when2meet

## Key issues / blockers
- Lack of preparation for the client meeting due to last minute scheduling
- Lack clarity about the project's requirements and scope before the client meeting.

## What you plan to do next week
- Continue reviewing the existing codebase which will need to be migrated to Python (https://github.com/andremun/InstanceSpace)
- Look into slurm for resource management and Melbourne Research cloud which currently spins the VM's for the existing MATILDA architecture
- Prepare further questions that arise from the above research, inorder to get a better understanding of the project's requirements
- Explore and decide up research topic for individual research essay proposal
