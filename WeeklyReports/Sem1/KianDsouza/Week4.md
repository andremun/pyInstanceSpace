## What I have done this week
- Spent time going through the Agenda items, while preparing for the sprint planning session.
- Actively engaged in the sprint planning session and sizing of tasks, contributing necessary tasks that needed to be added to the backlog.
- Watched the videos provided by the client to gain a better understanding of the existing MATLIDA application logic and functioning.
- Setup a time for the next team meeting, by creating a when2meet link as the next class falls on a public holiday, and the following class is in 3 weeks time.
- Started rough sketch for the existing system's architecture diagram, and spent time reviewing the existing codebase including the MATLAB code.
- Completed research essay proposal, and reviewed relevant related research papers on the selected topic.

## Key issues / blockers
- Change in github repository back to the orginal one setup for the subject, led to some confusion, and required migration of existing work and task (kanban) board.
- Researching topics for the research proposal took longer than expected, as I was unsure about what topic to go ahead with, and spent time reviewing a variety of research papers.
- I had a number of assignments for different subjects this week, and was not able to make alot of progress on my tasks.
- Lack of access to the front end code and a login to the MATILDA apllication is blocking me on my task of creating documentation on the API's that need to be created by the team.

## What I plan to do next week
- Collaborate with Xin on the task of creating the architecture diagram of the existing application, which will allow to bring the team up to speed with how the application currently works.
- Collaborate with Nathan in setting a docker container for the new backend based staging environment
