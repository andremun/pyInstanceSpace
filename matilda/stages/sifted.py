"""Provides functionality for feature selection and optimization in data analysis.

The SIFTED function performs the following steps:
  - Feature correlation analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.
  - Clustering of features based on their correlation to identify distinct groups.
  - Optimization using genetic algorithms (GA) or brute-force search to find the best
    feature combination that optimizes a specific cost function, typically related to
    model performance.
