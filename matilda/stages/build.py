"""Perform instance space analysis on given dataset and configuration.

Construct an instance space from data and configuration files located in a specified
directory. The instance space is represented as a Model object, which encapsulates the
analytical results and metadata of the instance space analysis.

The main function in this module, `build_instance_space`, reads the necessary
data from the provided directory, performs instance space analysis, and then
constructs a Model object that represents this analysis. This Model object can
then be used for further analysis, visualization, or processing within the
larger framework of the Matilda data analysis suite.

Functions:
    build_instance_space(rootdir: str) -> Model:
        Construct and return a Model object after performing instance space analysis
        on the data and configurations found in the specified root directory.

Example usage:
    python your_module_name.py /path/to/data
