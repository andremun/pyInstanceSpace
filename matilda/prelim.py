"""
Performing preliminary data processing.

The main focus is on the `prelim` function, which prepares the input data for further
analysis and modeling.

The `prelim` function takes feature and performance data matrices along with a set of
processing options, and performs various preprocessing tasks such as normalization,
outlier detection and removal, and binary performance classification. These tasks are
guided by the options specified in the `Options` object.
